### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Gopi!

I am a Machine Learning and Data Science graduate student at the University of Southern California and a data science professional with 3+ years of experience solving complex business problems for CPG, Retail, Marketing and Pharma industries using advanced analytics, statistics, and machine learning.

I'm proficient in developing and scaling solutions for businesses using various frameworks such as Python, R, SQL, Excel, Machine Learning, Tableau, PowerBI and Git. Additionally, my expertise extends to deep learning algorithms, cloud computing, and NLP applications.

In my GitHub repository, you will find various projects and code samples that demonstrate my ability to solve real-world problems using machine learning and data science. Some of the projects include  predictive modeling, image classification, natural language processing and data structures using Python and C++. 

Feel free to explore my repository and get in touch if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.

I have a strong passion for exploring and adopting new technologies and discovering innovative ways to apply them to my work. I particularly enjoy taking on projects that challenge me to think creatively and outside the box. I am constantly on the lookout for new and exciting opportunities to further develop my skills and broaden my knowledge in the field.

Hit me up if you want to talk formula one, photogrpahy, machine learning, data science, or anything fun in life! :)
